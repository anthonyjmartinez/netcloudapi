# Contributing

Whether you have come to report issues, request features, or contribute code, thanks in advance for your interest in,
and contribution(s) to, NetCloudAPI.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Project Scope

NetCloudAPI is intended to provide a Python 3 interface to the Cradlepoint NetCloud API in order to facilitate the rapid
development of tools that leverage that API. At this time, direct *processing* of the returned data is out of scope.

## Requests
Given the limited resources of the development team there may be a delay in response to issues, feature requests,
and merge requests. That said, it is the aim of the project to provide responses to all reasonable community
interactions. Requests that violate the project Code of Conduct are subject to immediate removal, and any other actions
deemed appropriate by the project team.

Templates are provided within the project's GitLab page for each of the following:

### Issues

With any issue submission please include the following:
* A meaningful title indicative of the problematic behavior
* Detailed steps to reproduce the issue, including but not limited to:
    * Local environment configuration
    * Specific use case for the classes or methods in question
* Direct reference to any merge requests submitted to resolve the reported issue

### Features

For all feature requests please include the following:
* A meaningful title with a concise summary of the requested feature
* Detailed use cases for the feature request

*Note: Feature requests that are outside of the declared project scope are unlikely to enter the development queue
unless, or until, the development team agrees to a change of scope.*

### Merge Request Process

1. Rebase your branch from Master, execute all unit tests, and provide a passing validation report immediately prior to
creating a Merge Request
2. Update the README.txt, using Windows CRLF for compatibility with Windows users, with details of changes to the
interface, and any additional dependencies.
3. Increase the version numbers in any files (setup.py, etc.), and the README.txt, to the new version that this
Merge Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

*Note: Merge Requests lacking unit tests or documentation will not be accepted.*

## Style

The NetCloudAPI project strives to maintain consistency and readability throughout. As such we recommend some of the
following as resources to follow:

* [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [A Hitchhiker's Guide to Python - Structuring Your Project](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/)
* [Dive Into Python 3 - Packaging Python Libraries](http://www.diveintopython3.net/packaging.html)
* [Python 3's Unittest Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by [contacting the project team][abuse] All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
